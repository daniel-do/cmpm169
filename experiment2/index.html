			<h1>Experiment 2 - Vector Art, Animation & Interactivity</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Imitate</h2>
				<p>I was inspired by the <a href="http://www.generative-gestaltung.de/2/sketches/?01_P/P_2_1_4_04">P_2_1_4_04 </a>generative design. I wanted to explore how objects move based on a given point of origin.</a></p>
				<p>I wanted to keep the general animation of the sliders to maintain the effect of fireworks or a growing and shrinking circle within a larger circle.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Integrate</h2>
				<p> I combined the concepts of sliders and rotating elements to create a visually dynamic and interactive sketch. The sliders, represented by colorful bars, are arranged in a circular pattern, resembling a rose. The rotation of these sliders is controlled by a sine wave, producing a smooth and rhythmic animation. The use of mouse interaction introduces an additional layer, allowing the user to initiate a change in the scene. When the mouse is pressed, the sliders move with the pointer, creating an engaging effect as if the entire rose responds to the user's input. The color of the background changes randomly with each mouse click, enhancing the overall aesthetic. This integration of sliders, rotation, and mouse interaction results in a lively and playful visual experience that combines different techniques to form a cohesive and interactive art piece.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Innovate</h2>
				<p>This code serves as a jumping-off point for crafting a genuinely unique and novel interactive art piece. By manipulating the sliders' rotation and position based on a sine wave, there's room for creative exploration to enhance the visual dynamics. Someone could experiment with diverse color schemes for both the sliders and the background, introducing a variety of moods and atmospheres. Additionally, modifying the interaction triggered by mouse presses opens up possibilities for dynamic transformations. Someone might consider integrating more complex mathematical functions for slider motion, creating intricate patterns and shapes. The concept of sliders responding to mouse movements can be expanded to include other interactive elements or gestures, fostering a more immersive user experience. This code provides a foundation that encourages experimentation, enabling the development of an entirely new and distinctive interactive visual composition through simple and intuitive modifications.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>Creating this interactive art piece was a mix of highs and lows. The process of making sliders rotate in a circular pattern was initially challenging, but once I grasped the concept of using a sine wave, things started flowing smoothly. It was rewarding to see the sliders dance rhythmically, creating an engaging visual effect. The incorporation of mouse interaction added an exciting dimension, allowing users to influence the scene with a simple click. However, adjusting the sliders' positions and managing their rotation speed was pretty challenging. There were moments of frustration, especially when trying to integrate the mouse movement to place the origin at the correct mouse position. Despite the challenges, the thrill of experimenting with colors and exploring how different parameters could transform the piece made the creative journey worthwhile.</p>
