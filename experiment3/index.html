			<h1>Experiment 3 - Generative Methods</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Imitate</h2>
				<p>I was inspired by the <a href="http://www.generative-gestaltung.de/2/sketches/?01_P/P_2_1_1_04">P_2_1_1_04 </a>generative design. I wanted to explore how objects moved relative to the mouse pointer's position.</a></p>
				<p>Keeping the following effect from the original design was essential in creating my desired effect of fish following the mouse pointer, which I interpret as fish food.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Integrate</h2>
				<p>I created an interactive fish feeding ocean where the fish dynamically respond to the movement of the mouse pointer. The integration of the code involves two key techniques. First, the fish shapes rotate to face the direction of the mouse pointer, creating the illusion that they are always looking towards it. This effect is achieved by calculating the angle between the fish and the mouse pointer. Second, the fish move towards the mouse pointer, creating a responsive and dynamic movement. The integration of these two techniques results in a visually engaging and interactive animation where the fish not only follow the mouse but also orient themselves in the direction of movement. The background color is set to a vibrant blue to enhance the aquatic theme. Overall, the combination of these techniques results in a playful and responsive visual experience, where the fish appear to swim towards and follow the mouse pointer, creating a sense of interaction and liveliness in the scene.</p>

				<h2>Innovate</h2>
				<p>This is an exciting starting point for crafting something genuinely distinctive and fresh that people would enjoy. This could be catered more towards children with simple fish-like interactions. The fish sprite asset was particularly fun to add into my generative design becuase I had previously designed the fish for a past, personal game project, so it made reusing this fish gave story behind this piece. Expanding on this foundation, I could explore various modifications, such as introducing additional sprite assets for different fish species or incorporating elements like underwater plants or bubbles to enhance the aquatic ambiance. Adjusting the behavior of the fish, like altering their speed or introducing patterns in their movement, could further contribute to the uniqueness of the scene. Additionally, experimenting with a diverse color palette or implementing subtle animations, such as gentle ripples or twinkling effects, could add a layer of charm and originality. By building upon the existing code, I have the flexibility to experiment with creative elements, allowing me to tailor the visual experience and create something novel that reflects my personal style and vision.</p>

				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>Creating this interactive art piece was an enjoyable journey with its highs and lows. One of the highs was integrating the fish sprite asset from a past game project, which brought a sense of familiarity and a personal touch to the artwork. Designing the fish to face the mouse pointer and move dynamically in that direction added a playful and responsive element to the scene, creating a visually engaging experience. On the flip side, I encountered a challenge in fine-tuning the movement behavior to strike the right balance between responsiveness and fluidity. Adjusting the size of the fish based on the mouse's proximity added depth to the interaction but required careful calibration to avoid exaggerated or unnatural effects. I am overall super satisfied with my result as it was a mix of experimentation and problem-solving. I was able to recreate feeding fish and has a lot of potential to promote ocean and environment-related topics.</p>
