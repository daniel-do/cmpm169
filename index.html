					<h2>About Me</h2>
					<p>Hi all! My name is Daniel and I'm a fourth year CS:GD major. I like to dance (hip-hop) in my free time (look up Cruz Ctrl) and I've been at it for about 13 or so years now! I have been inspired by games ever since I was young. I have experience in high and low level programming languages, and web-based programming. I would love to get to know everyone!</p>
